# Image Effects Addon
Extends the Drupal 8 Image Effects module to add additional effects.

As of right now this module only adds one additional image effect called "Overlay using multiply". The "overlay using multiply" effect is (more or less) a direct copy of the Drupal 7 Imagecache Actions' effect of the same name.
